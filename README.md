### About Me:
I am Aslam Sikder, an enthusiastic and detail-oriented software engineer and AI/ML Researcher with a strong background in Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology (DUET). My expertise includes working with technologies like Django, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and performing Exploratory Data Analysis using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

I have published multiple research papers on predicting purchase intentions using machine learning and deep learning techniques, and have additional two papers under review. With experience in both academia and research, I currently serve as a Trainer in Web Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning. I have previously worked as an Assistant Professor in Computer Science & Engineering, and have contributed to various projects in the past.

I am always eager to collaborate on projects, research, learn new technologies, and solve complex problems through innovative solutions.
