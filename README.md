### Hi there 👋, Assalamu Alaikum.
I’m Aslam Sikder, an AI Engineer and Researcher passionate about building scalable, intelligent systems that bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.

With a strong academic foundation (BSc. & MSc. in Computer Science & Engineering) and 3+ years of experience in machine learning, deep learning, and LLM-based agentic systems, I specialize in end-to-end AI solutions — from model design to deployment.

I’ve developed predictive models using Transformers, TabTransformer, and ensemble methods, created intelligent document checkers using LangChain and Hugging Face, and deployed ML apps. My research has been published in top venues, including IEEE, focusing on predictive modelling and the application of deep learning.

As a Certified Trainer & Assessor, I’ve also mentored students and professionals on real-world AI tools, data science workflows, and web development. I am always eager to collaborate on projects, research, learn new technologies, and solve complex problems through innovative solutions.

🛠️ Core Technical Skills:
- Programming Language: Python, SQL, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ML/DL: Supervised, Unsupervised & Ensemble Learning, RF, XGBoost, ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformer
- Frameworks/Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Flask, Django, Streamlit, REST APIs.
- LLMs & Agents: LangChain, Open Source LLM APIs, Agentic AI Pipelines, VectorDBs (FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone)
- Data Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Cloud Deployment: AWS, Streamlit
- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Tools: Git, GitHub, SPSS, Jupyter, Anaconda, Colab, VS Code, Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Problem-Solving: Active participation in coding challenges on online platforms

🌱 I’m currently exploring Agentic AI and Explainable AI <br>
